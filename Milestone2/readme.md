## 📌 Project Overview

**FranchiseOps AI** is an intelligent, secure and multi-user franchise operations management platform developed as part of **Infosys Springboard Internship 7.0 – Milestone 2**.

The project transforms a single-user franchise operations prototype into an enterprise-oriented, role-based multi-tenant platform. It integrates secure authentication, granular authorization, operational analytics, six autonomous background agents and an SQL-powered AI Copilot into one unified application.

The platform enables administrators, franchise owners, store managers, staff members and auditors to access operational information according to their responsibilities and permissions.

Unlike systems that generate unsupported answers, the AI Copilot is designed around deterministic, whitelisted SQL queries so that operational answers are grounded in database records.

### 🎯 Project Objectives

- Integrate the Milestone 1 authentication system with the provided FastAPI application.
- Implement secure JWT-based authentication and account protection.
- Introduce five distinct user roles with server-side RBAC.
- Restrict Store Manager data access to the assigned outlet.
- Develop an administrative dashboard for centralized user management.
- Improve the SQL-powered AI Copilot with 15+ additional question patterns.
- Integrate six autonomous operational agents.
- Improve the frontend with a responsive interface and dark mode.
- Provide secure and controlled access to franchise operational information.

# 🔐 1. Authentication and Security

The authentication module integrates the Milestone 1 login and account recovery functionality into the FastAPI application.

### JWT-Based Authentication

- Secure user login using email and password.
- Signed JWT access tokens.
- Token transmission through the HTTP Authorization header.
- Bearer-token validation for protected API requests.
- Token revocation during logout.
- Immediate rejection of tokens belonging to locked accounts.

Example authorization header:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
```

### Password Security

- Password hashing using bcrypt or PBKDF2.
- Minimum password length of eight characters.
- At least one uppercase character.
- At least one lowercase character.
- At least one numeric character.
- At least one special character.
- Password confirmation during registration and recovery.
- Current-password verification before password changes.

### Account Protection

| Security Feature | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| Failed Login Attempts | Account lockout after five consecutive incorrect passwords |
| Generic Login Errors | Prevents revealing whether an email exists |
| JWT Validation | Checks token authenticity and validity |
| Token Revocation | Invalidates logged-out sessions |
| Account Locking | Prevents locked users from accessing protected APIs |
| Password Reset | Supports account recovery |
| Credential Protection | Passwords are never displayed in the frontend |

---

# 🛡️ 2. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

The application implements five distinct roles.

Permissions are enforced on the backend using:

- `ROLE_MENU` – Defines which pages a role can access.
- `ROLE_CAPS` – Defines which operations a role can perform.
- `menu_for(user)` – Returns permitted navigation items.
- `need(ctx, capability)` – Validates access to protected operations.

Unauthorized requests are rejected with:

```http
HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
```
